<p1 style= "text-align: centre;"> A new man in the city walks down the streets of Delhi and ends up enjoying a fair of entire Indian culture in one go. Isn’t it amazing that being the capital of India, Delhi harbours all people from various places belonging to various cultures and ethnicity? It is the place where you can find a glimpse of grand Indian and cross-border diversity at a single place. When we talk about a particular culture or community, we must not forget about the FOOD and specially the desserts and sweets of Delhi as it is where everything starts.
